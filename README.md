<h1>Simple Linear Regression Project 🎯</h1>
<p>This project is aimed at implementing Simple Linear Regression to predict an individual’s weight based on their height. I worked with a dataset containing three columns: Gender, Height, and Weight. Since Gender is a categorical variable, I decided to ignore it for this analysis, focusing solely on the relationship between height (independent variable) and weight (dependent variable).</p>
 <h2>🌟 Project Objective</h2>
    <p>The goal of this project is to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Understand the concept of <strong>Simple Linear Regression</strong> and how it can be applied to predict continuous outcomes.</li>
        <li>Train and test a linear model using a simple dataset.</li>
        <li>Visualize the model's performance and predictions through a graph.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>📊 Project Breakdown</h2>
    <h3>1. Data Collection & Preparation</h3>
    <p>The project starts with gathering the dataset and performing necessary data preprocessing, such as handling missing values, normalizing the data, and dividing it into training and testing sets.</p>

<h3>2. Model Training</h3>
    <p>Using <strong>Simple Linear Regression</strong>, I trained the model to understand the relationship between the input (independent variable) and the output (dependent variable). This involved calculating the slope and intercept of the regression line to minimize the error.</p>



<h3>3. Visualization</h3>
<p>To illustrate the performance of the model, I generated a scatter plot along with the regression line overlaid on the data points</p>


<h3>4. Evaluation</h3>
<p>The model was evaluated based on how well the predictions aligned with the actual data, using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared score.</p>
